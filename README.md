LogWizard – A Simple Log Analysis & Brute-Force Detection Tool
This is a small cybersecurity project I built to understand how log analysis works and how brute-force attacks can be detected using Python.
I created this tool completely from scratch on Windows + VS Code, and I manually made a fake auth.log file to test it.

The main idea of the project is:

Read log lines

Look for failed login attempts

Count how many times an IP failed

If an IP fails 5 or more times → mark it as brute-force

Save the alert into a JSON file

This project helped me learn how log files work and how attackers try to access systems.

🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to understand real-world cybersecurity concepts like:

How logs capture authentication events

How brute-force attacks appear in logs

How to extract useful information using regex

How security tools detect suspicious behavior

Instead of just reading theory, I decided to build a mini log-analysis tool myself.

🔧 How I Developed LogWizard (My Step-by-Step Process)
1. Created project folder in Windows

I made a folder named LogWizard and opened it in VS Code.

2. Created a fake log file

Since Windows doesn’t have /var/log/auth.log, I created my own file called auth.log and added sample failed login entries.

3. Wrote Python code to read the file

My first goal was simply to print the log lines and make sure Python could read them.

4. Added regex to detect failed login attempts

I wrote a regex pattern to extract the IP addresses from log lines containing “Failed password”.

5. Counted how many times each IP failed

I used a dictionary to store IP → count.

6. Added brute-force detection

If an IP had 5 or more failed attempts, I printed a warning on the terminal.

7. Saved the output into a JSON file

Finally, I stored the detected attacks in alerts.json so it looks like a real security report.

This flow helped me understand every part of the logic instead of writing everything at once.

📁 Project Files I Created
logwizard.py   # Main script I wrote
auth.log       # Fake log file for testing
alerts.json    # Output file generated by the script
README.md      # This documentation

🧪 Sample Output (What my script prints)
Failed attempts per IP:
{'192.168.1.10': 5, '41.22.91.2': 1}

Checking for brute-force...
🚨 BRUTE FORCE DETECTED from 192.168.1.10 - Attempts: 5

Alerts saved to alerts.json


And the JSON file looks like:

[
  {
    "ip": "192.168.1.10",
    "attempts": 5
  }
]

📘 What I Learned

Building LogWizard taught me:

How to use regex in Python

How authentication logs look in Linux

How brute-force attacks appear in real logs

How to process text files line by line

How to generate alerts and store them in JSON

How to structure a small cybersecurity project

For me, this was a very practical exercise in understanding how security monitoring tools work internally.

💡 Possible Next Steps

In future, I want to improve LogWizard by adding:

Time-window detection

Sudo misuse detection

Log tampering detection

Email notifications

Real-time monitoring
